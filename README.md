# quiz-cards
An app designed to let users make quiz cards to text their knowledge on a given subject.

## Motivation
As someone who learns well with quiz cards, I felt that this would be a good thing to build to help myself and other users retain knowledge on a given subject or subjects.

## Build status
Currently just have basic front-end JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

## How to use?
First the user adds a new card, then enters a question, then an answer. The user can then test their knowledge on a question by bringing up a card and flipping over afer having guessed an answer.

## Contribute

Any help implementing future development (see "Future Development" Section for more) and any other suggestions would be useful

## Credits
Made with help from "20 JavaScript Projects" class on Udemy.

#### Anything else that seems useful

## Future Development
Eventually, what I would like to do is the following:
1. Track how many times questions were answered right and wrong.
2. Categorize cards by subject if there are multiple subjects.
