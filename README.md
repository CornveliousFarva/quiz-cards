# quiz-cards
An app designed to let users make quiz cards to text their knowledge on a given subject.

## Motivation
As someone who learns well with quiz cards, I felt that this would be a good thing to build to help myself and other users retain knowledge on a given subject or subjects.

## Build status
Currently just have basic front-end JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

## Code style
If you're using any code style like xo, standard etc. That will help others while contributing to your project. Ex. -

<!— [![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/feross/standard) —!>
 
## Screenshots
Include logo/demo screenshot etc.

## Tech/framework used
Front-end JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with fontawesome.


## Features
As of this version, all it does is store cards on the front-end

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
First the user adds a new card, then enters a question, then an answer. The user can then test their knowledge on a question by bringing up a card and flipping over afer having guessed an answer.

## Contribute


## Credits
Give proper credits. This could be a link to any repo which inspired you to build this project, any blogposts or links to people who contrbuted in this project. 

#### Anything else that seems useful

## License
A short snippet describing the license (MIT, Apache etc)

## Future Development
Eventually, what I would like to do is the following:
1. Track how many times questions were answered right and wrong.
2. Categorize cards by subject if there are multiple subjects.
